# Swift Concurrency Introduction
It is a SwiftUI basic application showing how to fetch an image from the website.

## There are shown two ways of fetching images using:
- Completion Handler
- Async/Await

## Source of Data
I used this website: https://picsum.photos that provides random images as a URL link or by API call.

## Next step
Implementation API and fetching more images in UI when scroll down.
